#### By _**Daniel Wulff**_

## Description

_This is an example of java use, specifically behavior driven development. This is a  website that gives a user a crude interface to input a sentence to be "puzzled". The website will then take you to a new page with a new sentence the same as the previous sentence but with dashes where all the vowels were._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Be sure to place all provided files/folders as seen in the repository into a single directory_
* _Make sure the version 2.12 or new of gradle is installed on your system (entering "gradle -v" into the command line should give you the version of the installed gradle system)_
* _To view the webpage, change the command line directory to be the root of the project folder._
* _type "gradle run" into the command line._
* _Open a browser and browse to http://localhost:4567/_

## Known Bugs

_No known issues at this time._

## Support and contact details

_If you find any errors or have trouble viewing the website feel free to contact Daniel: danielwulff.ee@gmail.com_

## Technologies Used

_The website is written in java, by using spark as the web framework. Template files were created in html using bootstrap. Additionally unit testing was done using jUnit, and interface testing was done using FluentLenium. In this way, the website was tested thoroughly during development using behavior driven development patterns (with the help of Gradle to keep track of our dependencies)._
